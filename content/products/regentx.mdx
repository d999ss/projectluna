## Overview

RegenTX is Tiger BioSciences' comprehensive regenerative medicine division, offering an advanced platform of tissue-engineered products and allografts designed to optimize clinical outcomes in orthopedic, dental, wound care, and ophthalmic applications. Leveraging Controlled Aseptic Manufacturing Process (CAMP) protocols and cutting-edge tissue engineering technologies, RegenTX delivers superior solutions for bone regeneration, soft tissue reconstruction, and cellular therapies.

## Platform Capabilities

### Tissue Engineering Excellence

RegenTX employs state-of-the-art tissue engineering technologies to develop biomimetic scaffolds and allografts that closely replicate native tissue architecture. Our platform integrates:

- **Advanced Biomaterial Scaffolds**: Collagen-hydroxyapatite composite matrices that provide both osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties
- **Precision Processing**: Optimized demineralization protocols that preserve critical growth factors including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)
- **Particle Optimization**: Scientifically validated particle sizes (250-1000 microns) for predictable bone regeneration and optimal remodeling kinetics

### CAMP-Based Manufacturing

Our Controlled Aseptic Manufacturing Process ensures the highest quality standards through:

- **ISO-Certified Cleanroom Facilities**: Class 10,000 (ISO 7) controlled environments with validated air particulate monitoring
- **Current Good Tissue Practice (CGTP) Compliance**: Full adherence to FDA 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations
- **Validated Aseptic Processing**: Comprehensive operator qualification programs and environmental controls
- **Rigorous Quality Assurance**: Multi-point testing protocols including donor screening, microbiological validation, and sterility assurance

### Technology Focus Areas

**Allograft Processing**
RegenTX specializes in cortical and cancellous bone allografts processed to maintain structural integrity while enhancing biological activity. Our cortical-cancellous blends provide the ideal balance of immediate structural support and rapid cellular integration.

**Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM)**
Our proprietary demineralization process removes 93% of the mineral component while preserving the organic collagen matrix and vital growth factors. DBM products offer both osteoconductive scaffolding and osteoinductive signaling for enhanced bone formation.

**Amniotic Tissue Allografts**
Processed from placental membranes, our amniotic products retain abundant growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components that promote epithelialization, reduce inflammation, and modulate immune responses.

**Barrier Membranes**
Designed for guided bone regeneration (GBR) and guided tissue regeneration (GTR), our barrier membranes provide space maintenance while directing selective cell repopulation for optimal tissue regeneration.

**Cell Culture Systems**
RegenTX Labs offers specialized growth media formulations for mesenchymal stem cell expansion, optimized for serum-free, xeno-free culture conditions that support regenerative medicine applications.

## Clinical Evidence and Applications

### Orthopedic and Spinal Applications

RegenTX products are extensively utilized in orthopedic surgery, accounting for a significant portion of the over 200,000 annual allograft procedures in the United States. Clinical evidence demonstrates:

- **Spinal Fusion**: DBM products are used in approximately 50% of spinal arthrodesis procedures, providing osteoinductive capabilities that support fusion without autograft harvest morbidity
- **Fracture Repair**: Cortical allografts deliver immediate structural stability in large defect reconstruction
- **Non-Union Treatment**: Cancellous chips facilitate rapid revascularization through creeping substitution mechanisms

### Dental and Periodontal Regeneration

Comprehensive clinical studies validate RegenTX allografts in dental applications:

- **Periodontal Defects**: Randomized controlled trials show 4.66mm pocket depth reduction and 5.22mm linear defect fill when combining allografts with GTR membranes
- **Implant Site Development**: Cortical-cancellous blends provide optimal space maintenance and bone volume augmentation
- **Ridge Preservation**: Mineralized matrices maintain alveolar architecture following tooth extraction

### Wound Healing and Soft Tissue

Amniotic membrane allografts demonstrate superior outcomes in:

- **Chronic Wound Management**: Enhanced epithelialization and reduced healing time in diabetic ulcers and venous leg ulcers
- **Burn Treatment**: Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties reduce infection risk
- **Surgical Reconstruction**: Extracellular matrix scaffolding supports native tissue ingrowth

### Ophthalmic Applications

Amniotic membrane transplantation serves critical roles in:

- **Corneal Surface Reconstruction**: Promotes re-epithelialization while minimizing scarring and neovascularization
- **Ocular Surface Disease**: Treatment of dry eye syndrome and limbal stem cell deficiency
- **Conjunctival Repair**: Reduces inflammation and supports rapid healing

## Regulatory Landscape

### FDA Classification Framework

RegenTX products are regulated as Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) under the FDA's tiered risk-based system:

**361 HCT/P Classification**
Products meeting the following criteria are regulated solely under 21 CFR Part 1271:
- Minimally manipulated processing
- Homologous use only
- No combination with non-tissue articles (except water, crystalloids, or preserving agents)
- Non-systemic effect or autologous/allogeneic use in first or second-degree blood relatives

**Current Good Tissue Practice Requirements**
All RegenTX facilities comply with:
- Establishment registration and product listing
- Donor eligibility determination (screening and testing)
- CGTP requirements for facilities, equipment, and personnel
- Adverse reaction and HCT/P deviation reporting
- Comprehensive labeling and traceability

**351 Pathway Considerations**
Products requiring more than minimal manipulation or intended for non-homologous uses follow Biologics License Application (BLA) pathways under PHS Act Section 351.

### International Standards

- **Europe**: Compliance with EU Tissue and Cells Directives (EUTCD) and individual member state regulations
- **Asia Pacific**: Adherence to regional tissue banking standards and quality management systems
- **ISO Certification**: ISO 13485 quality management systems for medical devices
