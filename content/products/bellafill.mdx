Bellafill is the only FDA-approved dermal filler clinically proven to last up to 5 years, representing a breakthrough in long-lasting aesthetic correction. Acquired by Tiger Aesthetics in October 2024 as part of the strategic Suneva Medical product line acquisition, Bellafill combines immediate volumizing effects with sustained collagen biostimulation through its proprietary PMMA microsphere technology. As the most extensively studied dermal filler on the market with over 1,542 patients across multiple clinical trials and 754,229 syringes tracked in 12-year post-market surveillance, Bellafill has demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy profiles.

The unique biphasic composition of Bellafill consists of 20% smooth, uniform polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres (30-50 microns in diameter) suspended in 80% purified bovine collagen gel carrier. Upon injection, the collagen component provides immediate volume correction and mechanical filling of the treatment area. Within one to four months, as the collagen gel is naturally absorbed by the body, the PMMA microspheres remain as a stable scaffold that stimulates the patient's own collagen production. This biostimulatory mechanism triggers the formation of both Type I and Type III collagen - the ideal collagen types for natural, long-lasting aesthetic correction. The microsphere size above 20 microns prevents phagocytosis by macrophages, while the smooth surface minimizes inflammatory response, ensuring biocompatibility and longevity.

Bellafill holds the distinction of being the only dermal filler approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe acne scars, based on pivotal clinical trial results showing a 64% response rate at 6 months and 71% at 12 months, compared to just 33% for placebo controls. The product is also FDA-approved for correction of nasolabial folds with demonstrated efficacy up to 5 years. Clinical experience across 212 patients over 4 years revealed an exceptionally low adverse event rate of just 1.4%, with patient satisfaction rates reaching 99% for acne scar treatment and 87% overall in the 5-year nasolabial fold study. The 12-year post-market surveillance data further validates Bellafill's safety profile with an overall complication incidence of only 0.11% across nearly three-quarters of a million syringes.

Available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, and South Korea, Bellafill is indicated for patients over 21 years of age seeking long-term correction of nasolabial folds, acne scars, and facial volume restoration. The product is supplied in sterile, single-use 0.8mL prefilled syringes and is administered exclusively by licensed medical professionals. As part of Tiger Aesthetics' regenerative aesthetics portfolio, Bellafill complements the company's vision of providing innovative, science-backed solutions that deliver sustained aesthetic outcomes while minimizing the need for frequent maintenance treatments that often lead to "filler fatigue" among patients.
