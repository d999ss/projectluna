The Tiger View Surgical Retractor represents a significant advancement in surgical instrumentation for breast procedures, combining innovative cordless LED technology with ergonomic design to deliver superior visibility and precision. As a single-use, battery-powered lighted retractor, the Tiger View system eliminates the complications associated with traditional fiber-optic retractors, including cable interference, tangling risks, and inconsistent illumination. The integrated LED bulbs are strategically oriented to provide greater brightness than competitive retractors on the market, ensuring optimal visualization of the surgical field even in the confined spaces typical of breast augmentation, reconstruction, and mastectomy procedures. Available in three sizes with graduated centimeter markings, the Tiger View enables surgeons to accurately measure surgical pocket depth while maintaining clear, well-lit access to tissue planes.

Designed specifically for the unique demands of aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery, the Tiger View retractor addresses multiple clinical challenges simultaneously. Its lightweight, ergonomic construction allows for comfortable one-hand operation, significantly reducing surgeon fatigue during lengthy procedures while freeing the surgeon's other hand for precise tissue manipulation. The non-conductive materials and integrated smoke evacuation channel enhance safety during electrosurgical applications, while the compact profile minimizes unnecessary tissue trauma that can impact patient outcomes. Clinical evidence demonstrates that lighted retractors reduce the need for frequent overhead lighting adjustments, which typically occur every 7.5 minutes in 97% of surgical cases, allowing surgeons to maintain focus on the procedure and reducing overall operative time.

As part of the Tiger Aesthetics comprehensive portfolio of regenerative aesthetic solutions, the Tiger View retractor exemplifies the company's commitment to delivering cost-effective innovation that improves surgical outcomes. The single-use design eliminates sterilization concerns and cross-contamination risks while ensuring consistent performance for every procedure. Whether used in cosmetic breast augmentation, post-mastectomy reconstruction, lumpectomy, or implant revision surgery, the Tiger View provides surgeons with the enhanced visibility, ergonomic comfort, and operational efficiency required for optimal surgical results and improved patient safety.
