caregraFT is a dehydrated full-thickness placental membrane allograft developed by Tiger Wound Care utilizing their proprietary CAMPS (Cellular, Acellular, and Matrix-like Products) technology. This advanced wound care solution leverages the natural regenerative properties of placental tissue, preserving the complete three-layer structure including the amnion, intermediate spongy layer, and chorion. The product is engineered to act as a protective barrier that shields wounds from the external environment while maintaining the native extracellular matrix characteristics that support natural wound healing processes.

Processed using proprietary technology and terminally sterilized via gamma irradiation, caregraFT offers exceptional convenience with a 5-year shelf life at ambient temperature. The product's collagen-rich composition delivers structural support while retaining key ECM components that facilitate tissue regeneration and repair. Clinical evidence demonstrates that placental-derived biomaterials like caregraFT exhibit multiple therapeutic properties essential for wound healing, including anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, angiogenic, and anti-fibrotic activities. These combined characteristics help modulate wound inflammation, reduce infection risk, promote new blood vessel formation, and minimize scar tissue formation.

caregraFT is indicated for use in non-healing wounds, surgically created wounds, and chronic wound applications including diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. The product is regulated by the FDA under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product (HCT/P) intended for homologous use. Available in ten convenient sizes ranging from 12mm discs to 4x8cm sheets with HCPCS code Q4322, caregraFT represents Tiger Wound Care's science-driven approach to delivering next-generation solutions for chronic and complex wound management.
