Airway Medix provides specialized airway management and respiratory solutions designed to improve patient outcomes in critical care settings. As part of Tiger BioSciences' international division, Airway Medix develops innovative single-use medical devices specifically for mechanically ventilated patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), anesthesia departments, and critical care environments. The company's comprehensive portfolio addresses the most pressing challenges in airway management, including ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention, endotracheal tube maintenance, and patient comfort during prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The cornerstone of Airway Medix's technology platform is its third-generation closed suction system featuring proprietary balloon-based mechanical cleaning technology. This innovative approach combines dual operation of balloon swiping and suction to actively prevent biofilm buildup on the inner surfaces of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubesâ€”a major cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICU patients. Complementing this system is Cuffix, the first and only economical, self-contained, continuous disposable cuff pressure regulator that maintains optimal pressure between 20-30 cmH2O for up to 10 days without manual intervention. By continuously monitoring and adjusting cuff pressure, Cuffix helps prevent aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions while avoiding tracheal injury from over-inflation. The B-CARE oral care system rounds out the portfolio with its 360-degree brush design and integrated disinfectant delivery, simplifying the challenging task of maintaining oral hygiene for intubated patients.

Backed by 26 patents protecting its innovations across Europe, the United States, and Japan, Airway Medix combines better clinical performance with ease of use, lower infection risk, and significant cost savings. The Cuffix device received FDA clearance in August 2020, with subsequent clinical studies at leading US hospitals demonstrating superior maintenance of therapeutic cuff pressure compared to intermittent manual adjustment. Clinical evidence supporting the technology includes prospective randomized trials evaluating safety, performance, and ease of use, as well as broader research confirming that continuous cuff pressure control systems reduce VAP incidence in mechanically ventilated patients. By improving patient safety while reducing healthcare personnel workload, Airway Medix delivers sophisticated medical device solutions that address real clinical needs in intensive care environments.
