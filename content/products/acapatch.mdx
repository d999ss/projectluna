ACAPatch is an advanced acellular dermal patch developed by Tiger Wound Care that provides an effective biological scaffold for wound coverage and tissue repair. Utilizing sophisticated decellularization processing techniques, ACAPatch preserves the native extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture while removing cellular components that could trigger immune responses. This innovative wound care solution retains the natural collagen-rich dermal structure, providing both mechanical strength and a biocompatible framework that supports cellular infiltration, revascularization, and organized tissue regeneration.

The product's advanced processing technology removes immunogenic cellular debris including DNA, RNA, proteins, and antigens while maintaining the structural integrity and bioactive properties of the ECM. Terminal sterilization ensures safety and reliability, while the non-cross-linked natural scaffold preserves the biological signals necessary for wound healing. ACAPatch acts as a protective barrier against the external environment while simultaneously promoting the body's natural healing mechanisms, facilitating the critical transition from the inflammatory phase to the regenerative phase of wound repair.

Clinical evidence demonstrates that acellular dermal matrices like ACAPatch significantly improve healing outcomes across multiple wound types. Randomized controlled trials have shown superior wound closure rates compared to conventional care, with patients achieving complete healing in chronic diabetic foot ulcers that had previously failed standard treatments. The ECM scaffold provided by ACAPatch supports angiogenesis, accelerates epithelialization, and promotes granulation tissue formation, often requiring only a single application to achieve wound closure. Case series data shows healing times of 12-20 weeks for complex lower extremity wounds, representing a substantial improvement over traditional approaches.

ACAPatch is indicated for a broad range of chronic and complex wound applications including diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, lower extremity full-thickness skin defects, traumatic wounds, and surgical wounds requiring tissue reinforcement. The product's biocompatibility and low immunogenic potential make it suitable for patients who have not responded to conventional wound care therapies. Available in multiple convenient sizes ranging from 2x2cm to 4x8cm sheets, ACAPatch offers clinicians a versatile, evidence-based solution for challenging wound management scenarios.

Regulated as a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product (HCT/P) by the FDA, ACAPatch meets rigorous safety and efficacy standards for wound care applications. The product is available in the United States and select international markets, with regulatory pathways established for North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. Tiger Wound Care's commitment to science-driven innovation ensures that ACAPatch delivers the clinical performance and reliability that healthcare providers demand for optimal patient outcomes in wound care management.
