SimpliDerm is a pre-hydrated human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) engineered for soft tissue repair and reconstructive surgery applications. Manufactured using a proprietary decellularization process, SimpliDerm preserves the natural architecture of native dermis while achieving a high sterility assurance level (SAL 10^-6) through terminal sterilization with ionizing radiation. The product's innovative processing maintains key extracellular matrix components and growth factors, resulting in a more pliable and intact dermal scaffold that closely mimics the structure and function of native human tissue.

SimpliDerm has been extensively studied in breast reconstruction procedures, where it serves as a supportive matrix in two-stage, immediate post-mastectomy reconstruction. Clinical evidence from a multi-center retrospective study involving 107 patients demonstrated that SimpliDerm is clinically equivalent to AlloDerm RTU, with comparable safety profiles and complication rates. The product exhibited a 25.2% overall adverse event rate, with no events directly attributed to the matrix itself. Pre-clinical studies in non-human primate models revealed superior performance characteristics, including significantly lower chronic inflammatory responses, reduced fibrotic marker expression, and more favorable tissue remodeling compared to competing products.

The technology behind SimpliDerm emphasizes rapid cellular repopulation and revascularization, facilitating enhanced healing and integration with host tissue. Available in both perforated and non-perforated configurations with multiple size options (rectangular and ellipse shapes), SimpliDerm offers surgeons flexibility to address diverse anatomical requirements. The matrix's uniform thickness (0.90-1.99mm range) and superior suture retention strength contribute to predictable surgical outcomes. As a regulated HCT/P (Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products) under FDA 21 CFR Part 1271, SimpliDerm meets stringent safety standards for donor screening, infectious disease testing, and current good tissue practice requirements, making it a reliable option for soft tissue reconstruction in the United States market.
