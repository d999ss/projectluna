bioCARE provides comprehensive tissue banking and processing services that serve as the critical foundation for regenerative medicine and transplant therapies. As an AATB-accredited tissue bank operating under the Tiger BioSciences portfolio, bioCARE maintains the highest standards of quality, safety, and ethical practices throughout the entire tissue banking processâ€”from donor recovery through final tissue distribution. The facility operates in full compliance with AATB Standards (15th Edition, effective 2025) and FDA regulations governing Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) under 21 CFR 1270 and 1271, ensuring that every tissue processed meets stringent safety and quality requirements.

bioCARE's comprehensive services encompass the complete tissue banking continuum, including specialized tissue recovery operations with trained specialists available 24/7, rigorous donor screening protocols that exceed FDA requirements, and advanced infectious disease testing utilizing Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) technology for shortened exposure window detection. The facility processes diverse tissue types including amniotic membrane allografts, orthopedic tissues, and wound care materials, utilizing multiple preservation methods within sterile processing environments. Each tissue undergoes medical director review and maintains complete chain of custody documentation, providing full traceability from donor to recipient. This systematic approach has contributed to the industry's exceptional safety record, with transplant-transmitted infection rates documented at less than 1%.

The clinical applications supported by bioCARE's tissue banking services span multiple medical specialties, including orthopedics, ophthalmology, wound care, dermatology, and plastic surgery. Processed tissues enable advanced regenerative medicine therapies that leverage the natural healing properties of human tissue allografts, including anti-inflammatory, anti-scarring, and wound healing benefits. By maintaining mandatory AATB accreditation through three-year renewal cycles and adhering to both federal regulations and AATB standards, bioCARE ensures that healthcare providers and patients receive the highest quality tissue products for optimal clinical outcomes in regenerative medicine and transplant applications.
