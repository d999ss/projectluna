Viality is the only FDA-cleared Enhanced Viability Fat Transfer (EVFT) system featuring proprietary AuraClens™ surfactant technology designed to maximize fat cell survival during autologous fat grafting procedures. Developed through research at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital, Viality represents a breakthrough in fat transfer technology by incorporating Poloxamer 188 (P188), a nonionic surfactant that stabilizes adipose cell membranes damaged during harvest, significantly reducing apoptosis and enhancing long-term graft viability. The system combines advanced filtration through a 200-micron mesh filter with super-absorbent foam concentration technology to efficiently remove blood, oils, and cellular debris while preserving viable fat cells.

Clinical studies demonstrate Viality's superior performance, with multicenter trials involving up to 200 patients showing over 80% average fat retention at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups—making it the first and only system to achieve such high retention rates. The AuraClens-treated grafts exhibit 94% cell viability compared to just 33% in saline controls, with P188-treated samples demonstrating three times the live cell signal and 50% reduction in apoptosis. In breast augmentation and reconstruction procedures, the system achieved volume stability with only 3.59% average change between 3 and 6 months post-procedure. These outcomes represent a 31% improvement in fat retention compared to traditional saline rinse methods, providing surgeons with more predictable and consistent results across a broad range of aesthetic applications.

The Viality system offers exceptional versatility and efficiency for plastic surgeons, processing lipoaspirate volumes ranging from 50cc to over 1000cc in under 10 minutes. Its gentle processing technology protects delicate adipocytes from mechanical damage while maximizing concentration and increasing the volume available for reinjection. The system is indicated for breast augmentation (primary and revision), breast reconstruction, mastopexy, body contouring procedures including Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), facial fat grafting, and hand rejuvenation. As part of Tiger Aesthetics' comprehensive regenerative aesthetics portfolio, Viality is commercially available throughout the United States, representing the gold standard in enhanced viability fat transfer technology for practitioners seeking superior clinical outcomes in autologous fat grafting procedures.
