## Overview

Avéli is a revolutionary FDA-cleared cellulite treatment system that addresses the root cause of cellulite dimples through a minimally invasive, single-session procedure. Developed by Revelle Aesthetics and acquired by Tiger Aesthetics in November 2024, Avéli represents the first and only cellulite procedure that enables physicians to identify, release, and confirm treatment of the specific fibrous bands (septa) causing cellulite dimples in real-time.

## Understanding Cellulite Formation

Cellulite is caused by structural changes beneath the skin's surface. In the subcutaneous layer, fat pockets are separated by fibrous connective tissue bands called septa that anchor the skin to deeper structures. Over time, these septa bands can become tight and inflexible, causing small projections of fat cells to protrude unevenly into the dermis. This creates the characteristic dimpled appearance known as cellulite, primarily affecting the buttocks and thighs.

## Technology and Mechanism of Action

Avéli utilizes a sophisticated hand-held device that enables a three-step precision approach to cellulite treatment:

### 1. Guidance and Identification
The Avéli device is expertly guided by a trained medical provider, sliding between the skin and underlying muscle to locate the precise tight septa bands responsible for cellulite dimples. As the device passes a problematic fibrous band, a unique hook mechanism catches the tissue.

### 2. Confirmation
Unlike other treatments, Avéli provides real-time tactile and visual feedback. The provider can physically feel and see the septa band pulling the dimple downward, confirming which specific bands are causing visible cellulite before treatment.

### 3. Release and Verification
Once identified and confirmed, the device precisely releases (cuts) the individual fibrous septa. The provider can immediately verify successful release and observe improvement in the dimple appearance during the procedure itself, ensuring optimal outcomes.

This targeted, inside-out approach permanently severs the specific structural causes of cellulite dimples, allowing the skin to smooth naturally.

## Clinical Evidence and Efficacy

Avéli's effectiveness is supported by robust clinical data from multicenter pivotal trials:

### Primary Study Results
- **80% of participants** showed either "much improved" or "very much improved" results at 90 days
- Results were **sustained through 12 months** of observation
- Published in Aesthetic Surgery Journal (Stevens WG, et al., 2022)

### Pilot Study Outcomes
- **100% of 20 female participants** rated as "much improved" or "very much improved" at 180 days
- Assessments based on Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale

### Patient Satisfaction
- 45% reported being very satisfied with results
- 30% reported being satisfied
- 10% reported being somewhat satisfied
- Overall 85% satisfaction rate

### Durability
Clinical data demonstrates long-term reduction in cellulite appearance with visible improvements maintained one year post-procedure, representing a significant advancement over temporary treatments.

## Treatment Procedure

### Procedure Details
- **Duration:** Approximately 1-2 hours depending on treatment area
- **Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia
- **Technique:** Small incisions made around treatment area for device insertion
- **Approach:** Minimally invasive, single-session treatment
- **Setting:** In-office procedure

### Recovery and Downtime
- **Immediate Recovery:** Most patients resume normal activities within 24-48 hours
- **Side Effects:** Mild pain in first 24 hours, bruising and tenderness typically resolve within 30 days
- **Results Timeline:** Initial improvements visible within 2 weeks; full results apparent at approximately 1 month after swelling and bruising subside

## Ideal Candidates

Avéli is FDA-cleared for adult females seeking long-term cellulite reduction. Ideal candidates include:

- **Age:** Women between 21-60 years old
- **BMI:** 30 or lower, at or near ideal body weight
- **Cellulite Severity:** Moderate to severe cellulite on buttocks and/or thighs
- **Skin Quality:** Good skin elasticity with minimal skin laxity
- **Fat Distribution:** Minimal excess fat in treatment areas
- **Health Status:** Good overall health without uncontrolled diabetes or active skin infections
- **Pregnancy:** Not pregnant

### Important Limitations
Avéli specifically treats cellulite dimples caused by fibrous septa bands. It is **not designed** to address skin laxity or excess fat deposits, which may require complementary procedures.

## Regulatory Status

### United States
- **Initial FDA Clearance:** May 2022 for temporary reduction of cellulite appearance (3-month data)
- **Extended FDA Clearance:** September 2022 for long-term reduction in buttocks and thighs (12-month data)
- **Classification:** 510(k) cleared medical device

### International
- **Australia:** Regulatory clearance received November 2023
- **Expansion:** First international market entry representing significant growth opportunity

## Market Availability

Avéli is currently available at over **700 locations** throughout the United States, making it widely accessible to patients seeking cellulite treatment. The device launched commercially in May 2022 and has rapidly expanded across aesthetic practices, plastic surgery centers, and dermatology clinics nationwide.

Following Tiger Aesthetics' acquisition of Revelle Aesthetics in November 2024, Avéli has been integrated into a comprehensive portfolio of regenerative aesthetics products, positioning it as part of a complete lower body rejuvenation solution alongside complementary technologies like Viality fat transfer systems.

## Safety Profile

Avéli has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in clinical trials:

- **Heat-free technology:** Safe for all skin types without risk of thermal injury or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation
- **Common side effects:** Mild, self-limiting pain, bruising, and tenderness
- **Resolution timeline:** Most side effects resolve within 30 days
- **Procedure-related risks:** Minimal due to local anesthesia and minimally invasive approach

## Advantages Over Alternative Treatments

Avéli offers several distinctive advantages in the cellulite treatment landscape:

1. **Root Cause Treatment:** Directly addresses structural cause rather than temporary cosmetic improvement
2. **Single Treatment:** One-time procedure versus multiple sessions required by other modalities
3. **Real-time Confirmation:** Unique verification of treatment success during procedure
4. **Long-term Results:** FDA-cleared for sustained reduction through 12 months
5. **Precision Targeting:** Treatment of specific problematic septa rather than broad-area approaches
6. **Minimal Downtime:** Most patients return to activities within 1-2 days
7. **No Heat/Energy:** Safe for all skin types without thermal damage concerns

## Summary

Avéli represents a paradigm shift in cellulite treatment by offering the first and only procedure that enables precise identification, release, and real-time confirmation of the fibrous septa bands causing cellulite dimples. With FDA clearance for long-term reduction, robust clinical evidence showing 80% of patients with significant improvement sustained through one year, and minimal downtime, Avéli provides a scientifically-grounded solution to a widespread aesthetic concern affecting the majority of adult women. The single-treatment approach, combined with durable results and broad availability across 700+ U.S. locations, positions Avéli as a leading option for patients seeking definitive cellulite reduction.
