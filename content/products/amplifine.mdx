Amplifine is an advanced platelet-rich plasma (PRP) preparation system designed for regenerative aesthetics and therapeutic applications. As a 510(k) FDA-cleared Class II medical device, Amplifine delivers superior platelet concentration with 81% platelet yield and up to 5x concentration from a small sample of autologous blood. The system utilizes proprietary gel separator technology combined with anticoagulant preservation (ACD-A) to enable safe, rapid point-of-care PRP preparation in just 6-10 minutes. With exceptional efficiency in white blood cell removal (94%) and minimal red blood cell contamination (≤0.1%), Amplifine produces high-quality PRP ideal for facial rejuvenation, hair restoration, wound healing, and scar improvement.

The clinical evidence supporting PRP therapy demonstrates significant benefits across multiple aesthetic and medical applications. In hair restoration, studies show PRP increases total hair density by a mean of 45.9 hairs per cm² in patients with androgenetic alopecia, with improvements in both hair count and thickness sustained at 6-month follow-ups. For facial rejuvenation, clinical trials report moderate to excellent patient-reported improvements in periorbital wrinkles (78.3%), skin rigidity (60.9%), and dark circles (60.9%) at 6 months post-treatment. The growth factors concentrated in PRP, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), work synergistically to stimulate collagen synthesis, enhance angiogenesis, and accelerate tissue regeneration with minimal adverse effects.

Amplifine offers flexible treatment options with two tube sizes to accommodate varying clinical needs: a 6.5mL system requiring 13mL blood draw with 6-minute processing, and a 15.6mL system utilizing 30mL blood draw with 10-minute processing. Originally developed by Suneva Medical and acquired by Tiger Aesthetics in October 2024, Amplifine is available throughout the United States as part of Tiger's comprehensive regenerative aesthetics portfolio. The system's FDA clearance for mixing PRP with autograft and allograft bone for application to bony defects extends its utility beyond aesthetics into orthopedic and surgical applications, making it a versatile platform for practitioners seeking evidence-based regenerative solutions.
