Tiger Aesthetics offers a comprehensive portfolio of tissue expanders designed to provide surgeons with innovative solutions for controlled tissue expansion in breast reconstruction procedures. Acquired from Sientra in April 2024, these advanced tissue expansion systems represent the forefront of reconstructive technology, featuring groundbreaking innovations including the AlloX2 Pro—the first and only MRI-compatible tissue expander cleared in the United States. With proprietary dual-port technology and integral drain systems, these tissue expanders enable surgeons to manage post-operative complications non-invasively while maintaining optimal patient comfort throughout the expansion process.

The AlloX2 family of tissue expanders revolutionizes breast reconstruction with its unique dual-port design that provides unprecedented access to the periprosthetic space. This innovative technology allows surgeons to address seromas and perform diagnostic fluid sampling without additional surgical intervention, significantly reducing the need for postoperative ultrasound imaging by over three times compared to single-port expanders. The AlloX2 Pro takes this innovation further by removing 95% of the metal traditionally associated with tissue expander ports, achieving MRI-conditional labeling while maintaining minimal interference with radiation therapy—critical advantages for post-mastectomy patients who may require ongoing cancer surveillance and treatment.

Complementing the AlloX2 line, the ACX (Anatomical Controlled Tissue Expansion) series and Dermaspan tissue expanders offer surgeons versatility across diverse patient anatomies and clinical scenarios. The ACX Matrix features the only double chamber breast tissue expander available in the United States, providing differential expansion with optimal control for anatomically precise reconstruction. Enhanced by Portfinder technology—an FDA-cleared electronic handheld device that replaces traditional magnet-based methods—surgeons can precisely locate and access tissue expander ports with confidence. Clinical evidence from 10-year FDA studies demonstrates exceptional outcomes, with 92% surgeon satisfaction and 94% patient satisfaction, while published research confirms the efficacy of dual-port technology in managing common post-operative complications and improving device salvage rates in challenging cases.
