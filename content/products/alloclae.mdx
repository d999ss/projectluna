## Product Overview

AlloClae is the first FDA-cleared structural adipose filler specifically designed for aesthetic body and facial procedures. Developed by Tiger Aesthetics, this groundbreaking allograft adipose matrix provides cushioning, volume, and support through donor-derived adipose tissue that has been carefully processed to preserve its natural regenerative properties.

Unlike traditional dermal fillers or autologous fat grafting, AlloClae offers a ready-to-use, off-the-shelf solution that eliminates the need for liposuction while delivering natural, long-lasting volume restoration. The product maintains the innate 3D honeycomb structure of adipocytes along with extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and collagen that support the body's natural regenerative processes.

## Technology and Composition

AlloClae is composed of intact adipocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from sterilized donor adipose tissue. The proprietary five-step processing protocol uses a detergent-based method that:

- Preserves the 3D honeycomb structure of adipocytes for immediate volume at the application site
- Retains naturally occurring growth factors, proteins, and collagen for lasting results
- Reduces free oil fraction to less than 2% to minimize the risk of oil cysts
- Minimizes DNA content to reduce immunogenic response
- Achieves terminal sterilization to a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-6

The final product contains 93-99% fat tissue with minimal free oil layers, providing a stable scaffold that integrates with the patient's own tissues and supports host-driven adipogenesis and angiogenesis.

## Clinical Evidence

### Published Research

**Fanniel et al. (2025)** - Published in *Bioengineering* journal, this comprehensive study titled "Advancing Soft Tissue Reconstruction with a Ready-to-Use Human Adipose Allograft" demonstrated:
- Complete biocompatibility with no cytotoxicity in cell cultures
- Support for adipose-derived stem cell attachment and differentiation
- Stable graft retention in 6-month athymic mouse transplantation model
- Host cell infiltration and formation of new adipocytes and vasculature by 3 months
- Maintained graft stability throughout the entire 6-month study period

**Gold et al. (2024)** - Published in *Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology*, this real-world clinical experience study involved 9 expert cosmetic physicians treating 7 patient cases across the United States. Key findings:
- AAM demonstrated to be an easy-to-use, effective, and safe alternative to traditional fillers and fat grafting
- Successful volume restoration in face, hands, and body applications
- Minimal adverse events across diverse patient populations (adult, middle-aged, and aged patients)
- Nonimmunogenic with positive outcomes across all treatment areas

### Conference Presentations

**Khorsandi et al. (2024)** - Presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, highlighting AlloClae's unique characteristics and biocompatibility profile.

### Clinical Outcomes

- **Duration of Results**: Clinical experience shows results typically lasting 12-18 months, with many cases demonstrating volume retention for several years
- **Timeline to Optimal Results**: Initial improvements visible immediately, with optimal results developing over 3-6 months as tissue integration occurs
- **Safety Profile**: Terminal sterilization and proprietary processing ensure minimal immunogenic response with rare complications

## Treatment Indications

### Body Contouring
- Non-surgical Brazilian Butt Lift (liquid BBL)
- Hip dip correction (typically 10-50cc per side)
- Body contouring and volume enhancement
- Liposuction deformity correction
- Cellulite and tissue irregularity treatment

### Facial Rejuvenation
- Cheek augmentation
- Temple volume restoration
- Under-eye hollow correction
- Jawline contouring
- Mid-face volume loss

### Additional Applications
- Hand rejuvenation
- Scar correction and revision
- Breast enhancement and pre-expansion
- Labia augmentation

## Product Specifications

AlloClae is available in three vial sizes designed for different treatment areas and volume requirements:

- **12.5cc vials** - Ideal for facial applications and smaller body areas
- **25cc vials** - Suitable for moderate volume restoration
- **50cc vials** - Designed for larger body contouring procedures

These significantly larger volumes compared to traditional hyaluronic acid fillers make AlloClae a more cost-effective choice for body enhancement procedures like liquid BBL and hip dip corrections.

## Regulatory Status

AlloClae is classified as an FDA-regulated Human Cell and Tissue Product (HCT/P) for homologous use, following a different regulatory pathway than medical devices. The product:

- Is FDA-cleared for cosmetic use under tissue banking regulations
- Meets FDA tissue safety standards with terminal sterilization
- Complies with tissue banking and processing regulations
- Does not require 510(k) clearance as it is not classified as a medical device

## Procedure Details

AlloClae treatments are performed as office-based procedures under local anesthesia. The typical procedure:

- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes depending on treatment area
- **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia
- **Recovery**: Most patients return to normal activities within days
- **Results**: Immediate volume visible with optimal results at 3-6 months

## Ideal Candidates

AlloClae is suitable for patients:
- Seeking natural volume enhancement without surgery
- Lacking sufficient donor fat for traditional fat transfer
- Wanting to correct contour irregularities or asymmetries
- Experiencing volume loss from aging, weight changes, or previous procedures
- Desiring long-lasting results with minimal downtime

## Safety and Considerations

### Advantages
- Eliminates donor site morbidity associated with fat harvesting
- Terminal sterilization ensures product safety
- Minimal immunogenic response due to reduced DNA content
- Natural integration with host tissues
- Proven biocompatibility in clinical studies

### Potential Side Effects
- Mild swelling (common, temporary)
- Temporary bruising at injection sites
- Rare infection risk (minimized by terminal sterilization)
- Potential minor volume loss during integration phase

## Geographic Availability

AlloClae is currently available in the United States, with practices across multiple states offering this innovative treatment. The product launched in 2025 as part of Tiger Aesthetics' regenerative aesthetics portfolio expansion.

International availability, including CE mark certification for European markets, has not been publicly announced at this time.

## Clinical Differentiation

AlloClae represents a significant advancement in aesthetic medicine by bridging the gap between temporary dermal fillers and surgical fat grafting. The product offers:

- **Versus Traditional Fillers**: Longer-lasting results with regenerative properties and larger volume capabilities
- **Versus Fat Grafting**: No liposuction required, immediate availability, consistent processing, and reduced procedure complexity
- **Versus Other Allografts**: Proprietary processing maintains 3D structure, terminal sterilization for safety, and extensive preclinical validation

This unique positioning allows aesthetic practices to offer patients a differentiated treatment option that delivers natural, long-lasting results with minimal invasiveness and downtime.
