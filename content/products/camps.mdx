The CAMPs Platform represents Tiger BioSciences' comprehensive approach to cellular, acellular, and matrix-like products designed for advanced wound care and tissue regeneration. CAMPs—an innovative term that replaced the older designation of "cellular and/or tissue-based products"—encompasses biomaterials derived from autologous, allogeneic, synthetic, and xenogeneic sources. These advanced therapeutic solutions are specifically engineered to promote repair and regeneration of injured tissue by supporting critical changes in wound-healing physiology through intercellular and intracellular communication and extracellular matrix production.

The CAMPs Platform leverages bioactive extracellular matrix scaffold technology that mimics the structural and compositional aspects of native tissue, providing a unique tissue-specific microenvironment that regulates and guides cellular processes. When applied to the wound bed, these products release essential growth factors, cytokines, and bioactive molecules that stimulate tissue regeneration, reduce inflammation, and improve overall tissue quality. The three-dimensional porous architecture, combined with preserved bioactive constituents such as collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and growth factors like FGF-2, creates an optimal environment for fibroblast attachment, cellular proliferation, and organized tissue remodeling. Clinical evidence demonstrates that CAMPs can reduce healing time by up to 44% in diabetic foot ulcers while promoting robust revascularization and reepithelialization of chronic wounds.

With over 80 biomaterials currently available and regulatory approvals through multiple FDA pathways (510(k), PMA, and HCT/P exemption) as well as CE marking in Europe, the CAMPs Platform represents the forefront of advanced wound care technology. The platform addresses a wide range of wound types including diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns, and surgical wounds—providing clinicians with evidence-based solutions for managing complex, non-healing wounds that have proven resistant to standard care approaches. This comprehensive system of cellular, acellular, and matrix-like products offers healthcare providers the flexibility to select the most appropriate therapy based on wound characteristics, patient factors, and clinical objectives.
