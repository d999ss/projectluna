The TIGER GUARD Implant Delivery System represents a significant advancement in breast implant placement technology, designed to minimize surgical complications through innovative no-touch delivery. This sterile, single-use device features a proprietary hydrophilic coating that becomes exceptionally slippery when activated with sterile solution, reducing insertion force by over 95% compared to traditional finger-push techniques. By preventing direct contact between the implant and the patient's skin or surrounding tissue, the system achieves a 27-fold reduction in contamination risk, potentially lowering capsular contracture rates to less than 1% compared to 5-50% with conventional methods.

Engineered with universal compatibility for all major implant types and sizes available in the United States, the TIGER GUARD system accommodates smooth round, textured round, shaped, and anatomical silicone gel breast implants through its flexible, clear polymeric design with standardized sizing markings. The device's advanced engineering allows surgeons to use smaller incisions, reducing scarring while maintaining precise control over implant positioning and orientation. Clinical evidence demonstrates that the no-touch technique facilitated by delivery funnels significantly reduces surgical time, with infection rates dropping to 0.26% in large patient cohorts, well below industry averages.

As part of Tiger Aesthetics' comprehensive breast surgery portfolio, the TIGER GUARD Implant Delivery System supports both cosmetic augmentation and reconstructive procedures, integrating seamlessly with the company's Sientra silicone gel breast implants and tissue expander offerings. The system's FDA Class I classification and established clinical safety profile make it an essential tool for board-certified plastic surgeons seeking to optimize patient outcomes through evidence-based surgical techniques. By combining mechanical advantage with sterile barrier protection, this delivery system addresses the critical challenge of bacterial contamination during implant placement, supporting Tiger Aesthetics' commitment to advancing patient safety and surgical excellence in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery.
