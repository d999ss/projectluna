alloPLY is an advanced dual-layer amniotic membrane allograft manufactured by RegenTX Partners LLC, an affiliate of Tiger BioSciences. This innovative tissue scaffold leverages the natural healing properties of placental tissue to support wound healing and tissue regeneration. The dehydrated dual-layer design preserves the amniotic membrane's epithelium and basement membrane, retaining key structural components and extracellular matrix (ECM) elements that are critical for wound repair. As a collagen-rich, flexible allograft, alloPLY provides structural support while maintaining the biological activity of native tissue.

The product is specifically designed for standard wound care applications, offering a natural biological barrier that protects wounds from the external environment while promoting the body's innate healing mechanisms. alloPLY contains essential growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), transforming growth factors (TGF-α and TGF-β), nerve growth factor (NGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These bioactive components work synergistically to enhance re-epithelialization, stimulate angiogenesis, modulate inflammation, and reduce fibrotic scarring. Clinical evidence demonstrates that amniotic membrane allografts like alloPLY significantly improve healing rates and reduce healing time compared to standard wound care protocols.

Processed using proprietary technology and terminally sterilized via gamma irradiation, alloPLY offers the convenience of shelf-stable storage for up to two years at ambient temperature. The product is regulated as a Human Cell and Tissue Product (HCT/P) under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, meeting FDA criteria for minimal manipulation and homologous use. With reimbursement support through HCPCS code Q4323 and documented clinical success rates exceeding 85%, alloPLY represents a scientifically-backed solution for managing chronic wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns, and other challenging wound types that have failed to respond to conventional treatment approaches.
