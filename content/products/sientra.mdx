Sientra represents Tiger Aesthetics' flagship breast implant product line, acquired in April 2024 for $42.5 million from Sientra, Inc. This comprehensive portfolio of premium silicone gel breast implants features advanced high-strength cohesive (HSC) gel technology designed to deliver natural appearance, superior performance, and exceptional patient satisfaction. With FDA approval since March 2012 under PMA P070004, Sientra implants are backed by extensive clinical evidence from the largest silicone gel breast implant study to date, enrolling over 5,000 patients and demonstrating consistently favorable long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes.

Sientra's proprietary silicone gel technology sets it apart in the breast implant market. The implants feature either High-Strength Cohesive (HSC) or High-Strength Cohesive Plus (HSC+) gel, offering two degrees of softness while maintaining exceptional gel-shell integration. This advanced technology enables the implant's silicone gel and shell to work as a cohesive unit, creating a natural look and feel while minimizing wrinkling, resisting rupture, and maintaining excellent upper pole shape retention over time. The HSC gel provides a soft feel that mimics natural breast tissue with a strength rating of 36.32, while the HSC+ gel offers enhanced cohesiveness and fracture resistance with a strength rating of 44.16. Available in both smooth and microtextured surface options, Sientra offers over 340 breast implant configurations including round and shaped (teardrop) designs, with four different projection profiles: Low, Moderate, Moderate Plus, and High.

The safety and efficacy of Sientra breast implants have been extensively documented through rigorous long-term clinical studies. The FDA-required 10-year postapproval study enrolled 5,197 patients (10,327 implants) across primary augmentation, revision-augmentation, primary reconstruction, and revision-reconstruction cohorts. At the 6-year follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier risk of Baker grade III/IV capsular contracture was just 4.1% across all cohorts, with patient satisfaction remaining exceptionally high throughout the study period. The 10-year core study data demonstrated a rupture rate of 8.6% and a reoperation rate of 31.5%, with no cases of BIA-ALCL reported. Patients consistently reported high satisfaction rates, with 87% indicating their breast implants made them feel more feminine, and significant improvements in quality of life for psychosocial well-being from baseline measurements.

Sientra breast implants are FDA-approved for breast augmentation in women at least 22 years old and for breast reconstruction in women of all ages, including primary reconstruction following mastectomy, trauma, or severe breast abnormalities, as well as revision surgeries. The products are currently available in the United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and throughout the Middle East GCC region through established distribution partnerships. As a division of Tiger Aesthetics Medical, LLC, Sientra continues to represent a leading choice for plastic surgeons seeking premium silicone gel breast implants with proven clinical performance and comprehensive product options to meet diverse patient needs.
